> What if I don't want to install Git?

That's fine! There's a second option to clone the repository, follow these instructions.

- 1. Go to [the repository](https://github.com/Yoshiboi18303/Apex-Legend-Chooser-Code).
- 2. Click on the green `Code` button, then click on the `Download ZIP` button
- 3. Find the Zip file, right click on it, and then click on the `Extract All` button.
- 4. Put the files wherever you like, then click on the `Extract` button.

**Boom!** All you'll have to do is wait for the zip file to be extracted, then you can follow along.

### Serve the website

Make sure your terminal is in the folder you created from cloning the repository (or open one in that folder if you haven't already), then first run `npm install`, then run `ng serve --open`.

> Why use the `serve` command? Because this will build the project and refresh every time you update the source code.

> Why the `--open` option? That's because this will open the website immediately after it's built and the server is up, saving you some time.
